Take a video and replace the face in it with a face of your choice. You only need one image of the desired face. No dataset, no training.

You can watch some demos [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KHv8n_rd3Lcr2v7jBq1yPSTWM554Gq8e?usp=sharing). A StableDiffusion extension is also available, [here](https://github.com/s0md3v/sd-webui-roop).

## How do I use it?
> Note: When you run this program for the first time, it will download some models ~300MB in size.

Executing `python run.py` command will launch this window:
![gui-demo](gui-demo.png)

Choose a face (image with desired face) and the target image/video (image/video in which you want to replace the face) and click on `Start`. Open file explorer and navigate to the directory you select your output to be in. You will find a directory named `<video_title>` where you can see the frames being swapped in realtime. Once the processing is done, it will create the output file. That's it.

Additional command line arguments are given below. To learn out what they do, check [this guide](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/wiki/Advanced-Options).

```
options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SOURCE_PATH, --source SOURCE_PATH
                        select an source image
  -t TARGET_PATH, --target TARGET_PATH
                        select an target image or video
  -o OUTPUT_PATH, --output OUTPUT_PATH
                        select output file or directory
  --frame-processor {face_swapper,face_enhancer} [{face_swapper,face_enhancer} ...]
                        pipeline of frame processors
  --keep-fps            keep original fps
  --keep-audio          keep original audio
  --keep-frames         keep temporary frames
  --many-faces          process every face
  --video-encoder {libx264,libx265,libvpx-vp9}
                        adjust output video encoder
  --video-quality VIDEO_QUALITY
                        adjust output video quality
  --max-memory MAX_MEMORY
                        maximum amount of RAM in GB
  --execution-provider {cpu,...} [{cpu,...} ...]
                        execution provider
  --execution-threads EXECUTION_THREADS
                        number of execution threads
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
```

Looking for a CLI mode? Using the -s/--source argument will make the run program in cli mode.
